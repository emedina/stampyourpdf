## Description

Just a simple web site to stamp pdf files with some phrase you want to.

Useful when you have to send some PDF to someone and wants to track it.

This app was developed in 4 hours, just to test some grails plugins (caching headers, zipped/cached resources), it is offered as is.

## Features to implement

* Use SimpleDB to summarize how many PDFs the engine stamps
